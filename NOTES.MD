- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
z-score: procees of normalizing every value in a data set based on 
the distance from the mean when measured in Standard deviation units 
where values above the mean have positive value and values below the maen
have negative values,with mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1.

formula of the z-score is 
New value = (x – μ) / σ
x-original value
μ-mean (avarage)
σ-Standard deviation 

min-max scale
linear transformation is performed on the original data to
standardize the independent features present in the data in
a fixed range to handle highly varying magnitudes or values 
or units,Minimum and maximum value from data is fetched and each 
value is replaced according to the following formula.

new value =(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))

x-old value
min(x)-min value in data set
max(x)-max value in data set

normalization:
is a way to measure and transform the data in the same scale
to easily comparing the data used when data has varying scales
some times the data has larg differences between
ranges.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
JUnit: open source framwork for the java programming 
language help us to write and run repeatable test it
used for unit test of a small segment of code,
once we are done with code we should execute all tests
and it should pass every time any code is added.


unit test:unit is a small segmant of software code we write a test 
to make sure that the code work correctly,detect and protect against bugs in the future.

benefits:
1-reusable and reliable
2-test the performance of the code
3-any bugs are found esaily and quick
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
```
Tool combines in one place all the tools we need 
for sotware development project,provide:
1-Interface for developer to write code (text editor)
2-Translate the code that we write from humar readable code into machine language(compiler) 
3-help developer to detect errors and help to solve it(debugger)
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
java version (openjdk 16.0.1)
io
util
math
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
No the task was amazing thank you.
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
No i did not 
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes :
Know how to work with CSV files in java
Know how to work with junit test
